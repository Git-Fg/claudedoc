It’s available as a terminal-based interface, desktop app, or IDE extension.\n![OpenCode TUI with the opencode theme](https://opencode.ai/docs/_astro/screenshot.CQjBbRyJ_1dLadc.webp)\nLet’s get started.\n---\n#### [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)\nTo use OpenCode in your terminal, you’ll need:\n1.  A modern terminal emulator like:\n    -   [WezTerm](https://wezterm.org), cross-platform\n    -   [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org), cross-platform\n    -   [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org), Linux and macOS\n    -   [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), Linux and macOS\n2.  API keys for the LLM providers you want to use.\n---\n## [Install](#install)\nThe easiest way to install OpenCode is through the install script.\nTerminal window\n```\ncurl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash\n```\n*Terminal window*\nYou can also install it with the following commands:\n-   **Using Node.js**\n    -   [npm](#tab-panel-0)\n    -   [Bun](#tab-panel-1)\n    -   [pnpm](#tab-panel-2)\n    -   [Yarn](#tab-panel-3)\n    Terminal window\n    ```\n    npm install -g opencode-ai\n    ```\n    *Terminal window*\n    Terminal window\n    ```\n    bun install -g opencode-ai\n    ```\n    *Terminal window*\n    Terminal window\n    ```\n    pnpm install -g opencode-ai\n    ```\n    *Terminal window*\n    Terminal window\n    ```\n    yarn global add opencode-ai\n    ```\n    *Terminal window*\n-   **Using Homebrew on macOS and Linux**\n    Terminal window\n    ```\n    brew install anomalyco/tap/opencode\n    ```\n    *Terminal window*\n    > We recommend using the OpenCode tap for the most up to date releases. The official `brew install opencode` formula is maintained by the Homebrew team and is updated less frequently.\n-   **Using Paru on Arch Linux**\n    Terminal window\n    ```\n    paru -S opencode-bin\n    ```\n    *Terminal window*\n#### [Windows](#windows)\nRecommended: Use WSL\nFor the best experience on Windows, we recommend using [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://opencode.ai/docs/windows-wsl). It provides better performance and full compatibility with OpenCode’s features.\n-   **Using Chocolatey**\n    Terminal window\n    ```\n    choco install opencode\n    ```\n    *Terminal window*\n-   **Using Scoop**\n    Terminal window\n    ```\n    scoop install opencode\n    ```\n    *Terminal window*\n-   **Using NPM**\n    Terminal window\n    ```\n    npm install -g opencode-ai\n    ```\n    *Terminal window*\n-   **Using Mise**\n    Terminal window\n    ```\n    mise use -g github:anomalyco/opencode\n    ```\n    *Terminal window*\n-   **Using Docker**\n    Terminal window\n    ```\n    docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/anomalyco/opencode\n    ```\n    *Terminal window*\nSupport for installing OpenCode on Windows using Bun is currently in progress.\nYou can also grab the binary from the [Releases](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/releases).\n---\n## [Configure](#configure)\nWith OpenCode you can use any LLM provider by configuring their API keys.\nIf you are new to using LLM providers, we recommend using [OpenCode Zen](https://opencode.ai/docs/zen). It’s a curated list of models that have been tested and verified by the OpenCode team.\n1.  Run the `/connect` command in the TUI, select opencode, and head to [opencode.ai/auth](https://opencode.ai/auth).\n    ```\n    /connect\n    ```\n    **\n2.  Sign in, add your billing details, and copy your API key.\n3.  Paste your API key.\n    ```\n    ┌ API key││└ enter\n    ```\n    **\nAlternatively, you can select one of the other providers. [Learn more](https://opencode.ai/docs/providers#directory).\n---\n## [Initialize](#initialize)\nNow that you’ve configured a provider, you can navigate to a project that you want to work on.\nTerminal window\n```\ncd /path/to/project\n```\n*Terminal window*\nAnd run OpenCode.\nTerminal window\n```\nopencode\n```\n*Terminal window*\nNext, initialize OpenCode for the project by running the following command.\n```\n/init\n```\n**\nThis will get OpenCode to analyze your project and create an `AGENTS.md` file in the project root.\nTip\nYou should commit your project’s `AGENTS.md` file to Git.\nThis helps OpenCode understand the project structure and the coding patterns used.\n---\n## [Usage](#usage)\nYou are now ready to use OpenCode to work on your project. Feel free to ask it anything!\nIf you are new to using an AI coding agent, here are some examples that might help.\n---\n### [Ask questions](#ask-questions)\nYou can ask OpenCode to explain the codebase to you.\nTip\nUse the `@` key to fuzzy search for files in the project.\n```\nHow is authentication handled in @packages/functions/src/api/index.ts\n```\n**\nThis is helpful if there’s a part of the codebase that you didn’t work on.\n---\n### [Add features](#add-features)\nYou can ask OpenCode to add new features to your project. Though we first recommend asking it to create a plan.\n1.  **Create a plan**\n    OpenCode has a _Plan mode_ that disables its ability to make changes and instead suggest _how_ it’ll implement the feature.\n    Switch to it using the **Tab** key. You’ll see an indicator for this in the lower right corner.\n    ```\n    <TAB>\n    ```\n    **\n    Now let’s describe what we want it to do.\n    ```\n    When a user deletes a note, we'd like to flag it as deleted in the database.Then create a screen that shows all the recently deleted notes.From this screen, the user can undelete a note or permanently delete it.\n    ```\n    **\n    You want to give OpenCode enough details to understand what you want. It helps to talk to it like you are talking to a junior developer on your team.\n    Tip\n    Give OpenCode plenty of context and examples to help it understand what you want.\n2.  **Iterate on the plan**\n    Once it gives you a plan, you can give it feedback or add more details.\n    ```\n    We'd like to design this new screen using a design I've used before.[Image #1] Take a look at this image and use it as a reference.\n    ```\n    **\n    Tip\n    Drag and drop images into the terminal to add them to the prompt.\n    OpenCode can scan any images you give it and add them to the prompt. You can do this by dragging and dropping an image into the terminal.\n3.  **Build the feature**\n    Once you feel comfortable with the plan, switch back to _Build mode_ by hitting the **Tab** key again.\n    ```\n    <TAB>\n    ```\n    **\n    And asking it to make the changes.\n    ```\n    Sounds good! Go ahead and make the changes.\n    ```\n    **\n---\n### [Make changes](#make-changes)\nFor more straightforward changes, you can ask OpenCode to directly build it without having to review the plan first.\n```\nWe need to add authentication to the /settings route. Take a look at how this ishandled in the /notes route in @packages/functions/src/notes.ts and implementthe same logic in @packages/functions/src/settings.ts\n```\n**\nYou want to make sure you provide a good amount of detail so OpenCode makes the right changes.\n---\n### [Undo changes](#undo-changes)\nLet’s say you ask OpenCode to make some changes.\n```\nCan you refactor the function in @packages/functions/src/api/index.ts?\n```\n**\nBut you realize that it is not what you wanted. You **can undo** the changes using the `/undo` command.\n```\n/undo\n```\n**\nOpenCode will now revert the changes you made and show your original message again.\n```\nCan you refactor the function in @packages/functions/src/api/index.ts?\n```\n**\nFrom here you can tweak the prompt and ask OpenCode to try again.\nTip\nYou can run `/undo` multiple times to undo multiple changes.\nOr you **can redo** the changes using the `/redo` command.\n```\n/redo\n```\n**\n---\n## [Share](#share)\nThe conversations that you have with OpenCode can be [shared with your team](https://opencode.ai/docs/share).\n```\n/share\n```\n**\nThis will create a link to the current conversation and copy it to your clipboard.\nNote\nConversations are not shared by default.\nHere’s an [example conversation](https://opencode.ai/s/4XP1fce5) with OpenCode.\n---\n## [Customize](#customize)\nAnd that’s it! You are now a pro at using OpenCode.\nTo make it your own, we recommend [picking a theme](https://opencode.ai/docs/themes), [customizing the keybinds](https://opencode.ai/docs/keybinds), [configuring code formatters](https://opencode.ai/docs/formatters), [creating custom commands](https://opencode.ai/docs/commands), or playing around with the [OpenCode config](https://opencode.ai/docs/config).\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/edit/dev/packages/web/src/content/docs/index.mdx) [Find a bug?
